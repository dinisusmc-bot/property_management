# 2026-02-10 — Property Management Conversion

## Summary
Converted existing charter management (Athena/Atlas) to a multi-tenant property management platform for nick (dinisusmc).

## Tech Stack (Preserved + Enhanced)
- **Backend**: FastAPI + PostgreSQL (14 microservices → modularized)
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + MUI
- **Auth**: JWT + MFA (email) + impersonation + security audit logs
- **Payments**: Stripe integration (extended for rent/payouts)
- **Enhancements Added**: UUID keys, soft deletes, jsonb metadata, RLS, trigram indexes, GAAP ledger, scoped permissions

## Project Structure
- `~/projects/property_management/` — cloned from `git@github.com:dinisusmc-bot/property_management.git`
- Core hierarchy: **Owner → Property → Unit → Tenant**
- Roles: **Admin, Manager, Tenant, Owner, Contractor**

- Phase 12: Frontend E2E testing (forms, validation, CRUD) ✅
- Phase 13: JWT/OAuth2, MFA, impersonation verified ✅

## Git Deployment ✅
